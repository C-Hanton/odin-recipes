<h2>How to make a baked potato</h2>

<h3>Season the Potatoes</h3>
<p>Start off by rinsing and scrubbing the potatoes. Then, pierce each potato with a fork or knife so that steam can escape when baking. Coat the potato with olive oil (you can use your hands to rub it all over the skin or place the potato and oil in a zip-top bag and shake it up) and season with salt.</p>

<h3>Bake the Potatoes</h3>
<p>Bake in a 300 degree F oven until the potatoes are tender and golden brown, about 90 minutes.</p>
    
<h3>Top Potatoes</h3>
<p>Slice the potatoes and fluff the center. Then top with black pepper, butter, Cheddar cheese, chives, sour cream, or anything else you like.</p>

<h3>How long to bake Potatoes</h3>
<p>The baking time for baked potatoes will depend on the size of the potatoes. It can take anywhere between 50 minutes and 1 Â½ hours.</p>
